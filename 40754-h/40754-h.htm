<h2>TELLING A STORY.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/illus065b_d.png" width="105" height="125" alt="D" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />REAR and cold is the winter outside; but within
there is a bright fire on the hearth. Jane and
Susie, and Charles and John, and their elder sister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>Ann, are all seated comfortably in front of it. And now
the children call on sister Ann to tell them a story; and this
is what she tells them:&mdash;</div>

<p>"When I was a girl, and wanted to hear a story, and the
grown-up people didn't feel like telling me one, they would
say,&mdash;</p>


<div class='poem'>
"'I'll tell you a story about Jack O'Nory;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now my story's begun.</span><br />
I'll tell you another about Jack and his brother;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now my story's done.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Now, every time this was said to me, I would think that
I really should hear the story about Jack O'Nory, or the
other one about Jack and his brother. But it was always
the same; just as I thought the story was coming, I would
hear, instead, 'And <i>now</i> my story's done.'</p>

<p>"One day, when I begged for one of the stories, my aunt
told me that I couldn't hear about Jack O'Nory or his
brother, because Mother Goose never told the stories about
them; that she just began, and then thought better of it.
After that I didn't ask any more; but I said to myself, 'If
ever I get big, I'll find out those stories.' And so, sure
enough, I did. And I am going to tell one of them now,&mdash;the
one about Jack O'Nory himself.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"'It is a story that all came of his having a
great liking for buns. Jack lived in the next
house to Mother Goose, and every morning, if
she peeped between the curtains, she was sure
to see Jack waiting on the pavement for the
bun-man. You see the bun-man went around
very early, so that people could have their buns
for breakfast.</p>

<p>"'But one morning Jack slept too late, and,
when he ran out, the bun-man had already gone
by and was almost out of sight. Jack ran after
him, but could not catch him.</p></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/illus066.png" width="203" height="300" alt="Jack running" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"'It didn't seem to Jack a bit nice, not to have any bun with his milk
that morning; and so all day Jack kept saying to himself, "That bun-man
won't get by the house to-morrow morning without my knowing it,
I guess!" And this was the last thing
he thought of as he took off his shoes
and stockings at night before the fire.</p></div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus067a.png" width="300" height="343" alt="Taking off his shoes by the fire" />
</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"'But all his thinking did not seem
to be of much use; for, before he had
slept half as long as he wanted to, he
heard the jingle of the bun-man's bell.
Up he jumped, pulled on his clothes
as fast as he could, and had got on all
except one shoe, when the bell rang
below the window. Down he ran, but
the bun-man wasn't there.</p>

<p>"'Jack forgot that he had on only
one shoe, and started to run after the
man. He was soon only half a square behind him; but just then
the man turned a corner, and was out of sight. Jack turned the corner
too; but the man had walked fast and was just turning another corner.</p>

<p>"'Poor Jack began to think he was not going to get his bun; but
he still ran on, and turned the next corner and the next, for the bun-man
seemed to be always turning corners. Jack got very hot, and
was just beginning to cry, when, as
he was turning the ninth corner after
the man, he saw him go into a house.</p></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 273px;">
<img src="images/illus067b.png" width="273" height="325" alt="Following the bun-man" />
</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"'"Ah!" thought Jack, "that's
the place where they make the buns.
I'll hurry in after him, and then I'll
surely get my bun, and he'll tell me
the way home besides."</p>

<p>"'So in went Jack. But the man
was not to be seen. There was nothing
to be seen except buns, all in great
piles like walls, and all smoking hot. Jack
was very warm already, you know, and the
steam from so many hot buns made him
warmer still; but he tried not to mind it,
and walked on, looking all the time for the bun-man.</p>

<p>"'He could hear his bell every little while; but the more he tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
go where the bell was, the more he could not find it, Jack by this time,
had gone through so many rooms, that he did not know how to get out:
so he went down some stairs that he saw ahead of him, and found himself
in the place where the buns were baked.</p>

<p>"'There were plenty of men here, all in baker's caps; but instead
of making buns, they were pouring out milk for two
rows of little boys, who stood, each with a bib under
his chin and a bun in his hand. The strangest part
of it was that the boys did
not seem to be a bit hot,
while poor Jack was almost
melting. Jack thought that
if he could only drink some
milk, he should feel better.</p></div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/illus068a.png" width="346" height="300" alt="crowd of children getting milk" />
</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"'But just as he was about
to take his place with the rest
of the boys, they disappeared,
and instead of pouring out
milk, the men were shovelling
buns out of ovens on all sides of the room. Now, Jack had heard his
mamma tell about the great oven that buns were baked in, and he had
always wanted to see one: so he ran up to the door to look in.</p>

<p>"'The heat drove him back, and he turned quickly to run, just as one
of the bakers was putting his shovel in for more buns. The baker did
not notice him, and, the first thing Jack knew, the baker's elbow drove
him bump against the oven door.
My! how he screamed!</p></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus068b.png" width="300" height="216" alt="Jack in bed with a bandaged head" />
</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"'Then, all of a sudden, there
was no oven to be seen, only a
fire; and his mother was coming
in at the door,&mdash;not the bun-man's
door, but his own nursery
door,&mdash;saying, "Why, Jack, not
undressed yet! I sent you to
bed a half-hour ago!"</p>

<p>"'But she stopped suddenly,
and picked Jack up, hugging and kissing him, and calling his father to
go for the doctor. Poor Jack! what with the hurt on his head, and his
mother's crying, and the thought of the strange bake-shop, he wondered
whether he was Jack O'Nory at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"'While he was wondering the doctor came, and his mother began to
tell him about Jack's hurt. "You see, doctor," she said, "my little boy
went to sleep as he was sitting very near the fire, and fell over and cut
his head against the hot andiron."</p>

<p>"'Then Jack knew that the bun-man, the bake-shop, and the oven,
were all a dream. He told his mamma the dream, and she promised
him three buns every day till his head was well. Then she tucked him
up in his bed, and told him not to dream of the bun-man again.'</p></div>

<p>"So this is the story of Jack O'Nory. Some day 'I'll tell
you another about Jack and his brother, and <i>now</i> my story
is done!'"</p>

<h2>TURTLES.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/drop_a.png" width="75" height="150" alt="A" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />LMOST every one thinks of turtles as exceedingly
slow and stupid. Perhaps they may be rather slow,
though you know who won the race in the fable of
the turtle and the hare. As for their stupidity, I
doubt whether they are so very stupid, for I once
had one that seemed to me very bright.</div>

<p>When I put him on the floor or ground, he would stay
quite still, and draw in his head and legs, until I turned
away, or busied myself with something else; then he would
make off as fast as his little legs would carry him.</p>

<p>I once lost one in that way: so, now that I know their
tricks, I am more careful. But certainly that turtle must
have had some sense to be able to tell when my back was
turned, or even when I was not looking.</p>

<p>Their habits are quite peculiar. In summer they stay in
the water most of the time, coming out only now and then
to sun themselves on some log or branch. In the winter
they bury themselves in the mud, or remain in a torpid
state. When spring comes, they lay their eggs.</p>

<p>They live chiefly on bugs; but I have heard of one living
a whole year without any thing to eat. They are very
patient, and I have seen one try for hours to get over a
wall that one would think he could never get over; and yet
he would succeed.</p>

<p>I have a turtle now that will have a funny story to tell
his friends, if he ever reaches his native home again. This
is it: I once took him to school with me, and left him in a
box, with the cover half open, on a table in the dressing-room.
In about an hour I heard a suppressed laugh from
one of the girls, and, looking up, I saw Mr. Turtle calmly
walking into school. He wanted to learn something as well
as the rest of us.</p>

<h2>FEEDING THE SWANS IN WINTER.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 60px;">
<img src="images/drop_i.png" width="60" height="150" alt="I" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />T is a cold day in February. The icicles hang from
the trees. The pond is partly frozen over. Mary
and her dog Pug have come down to take a look at
the swans.</div>

<p>The swans are often fed by girls and boys in the
summer; but in winter they have few visitors: so they are
glad to see Mary, and waddle up on the ice to meet her.</p>

<p>She feeds them with something that looks to me like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
banana, and they eat it greedily. Pug looks on fiercely, as
though he did not quite approve of their doings, and had
half a mind to interfere.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">

<p>Take care, Pug: you had better keep in the background.
A blow from a swan's wing would not be good fun to a
small dog. Let the swans eat their luncheon in peace.</p>

<h2>THE SWALLOWS' NEST.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 62px;">
<img src="images/drop_c.png" width="62" height="150" alt="C" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HARLEY came from school one Friday afternoon.
He was going home with his grandfather, at whose
house he was to spend the next day. It was the
month of May; and the drive of ten miles among
the green trees and fields was very delightful.</div>

<div>
<img src="images/illus077a.png" alt="top of barn with birds" width="600" height="247" class="splitr" />
<img src="images/illus077b.png" alt="side of barn with tree and Charley" width="275" height="560" class="splitr" />
</div><p>There were no playmates for Charley at grandpa's; but
with a calf at the barn, several broods of chickens, and four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
kittens, he found
enough to occupy
his mind. He was up very early
in the morning, and it was after
ten o'clock when he came into the
kitchen rather hungry.</p>



<p>"Look under the cloth on the
table, Charley," called his grandma
from the sitting-room. "You'll
find a little cake I baked for you.
Don't you see it?" she asked, coming
into the kitchen. "There,
that one."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Charley, "I
thought that was a loaf."</p>

<p>Then, taking the cake in his
hand, he sat on a rock at the
foot of a tree a little distance from
the house, and began to eat with
great relish.</p>

<p>Not far from him, and a little
way from the other buildings,
was the corn-barn, and at one end of its roof was a bird-house,
which had been taken by two little birds for their
home. Charley saw one bird come out and fly away. While
she was gone, her mate kept watch at a short distance to see
that no harm came to the eggs that were within.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Charley noticed, that, in flying, these birds had different
motions from the sparrows and robins which lived about his
own home in the city, and, when he went nearer, he saw
that they were swallows.</p>

<p>As he watched them pass in and out of their house, he
observed that there was something inside that opened and
shut like a door. It was pressed back when the birds went
in, and sprang into place again as soon as they were inside.
Charley could not make out what it was, and ran to the
house to ask about it.</p>

<p>"Grandma," he said, "is there a real door to the swallows'
house?"</p>

<p>"They make one for themselves," she answered: "there
is no door to the box. You know their house stands where
it is exposed to all the winds, and, on some days since they
came, they must have felt the cold very much. But I saw
one come flying home one day with a turkey's feather in his
beak, and they worked away at it very busily until they had
placed it as you see. It keeps out the wind, and makes the
house much more comfortable."</p>

<p>Charley went back to look at the door again, and wished
he could be small enough, for a few minutes, to go inside
the bird-house, and see just how it was fastened. But he
could not have his wish, and the swallows kept their secret.</p>

<h2>THE GENTLEMAN IN GRAY.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Hush</span>, little May! Snuggle here by my side:<br />
Do you see in that corner a door open wide?<br />
That's the door of a house: if you watch it a minute,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>The shy little owner will come and sit in it.<br />
<br />
See! there he comes; in a gray velvet hat,<br />
With his shining black eyes looking this way and that,<br />
And his velvet-shod feet: if you stir but a lash,<br />
They'll twinkle and vanish as quick as a flash.<br />
<br />
What do you fancy he does in the dark,<br />
When the fire has gone down to the very last spark,<br />
When the girls and the boys are in bed and asleep,<br />
And there's never a cat on the carpet to creep?<br />
<br />
Why, out of his doorway he walks at his ease,<br />
And brings his relations and friends, if he please,<br />
He picks up the crumbs of your candy and cake:<br />
From the tiniest fragments a feast he can make.<br />
<br />
He swings on the tassels, he climbs up the shelf;<br />
He peeps in the mirror and winks at himself;<br />
He drops from the table, and lands with a thump;<br />
He slides down the sofa, and squeaks at the bump.<br />
<br />
There, now he grows bolder; he's out on the floor;<br />
He's eating an apple-seed there by the door;<br />
He's under the table; he's&mdash;where did you say?<br />
Oh, here he is! there he is! shoo! get away!<br />

<h2>THE FAITHFUL SENTINEL.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 82px;">
<img src="images/drop_w.png" width="82" height="150" alt="W" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HEN there is war, the safety of an army may depend
on the quickness and courage of one sentinel. If he
sleeps at his post, he is shot. The sentinel I am
to tell you about never fell asleep on duty, never
ran away from an enemy, carried no musket, and
wore no uniform.</div>
<div>
<img src="images/illus087a.png" alt="children running toward cabin, dog runnning into brush" width="600" height="322" class="splitr" />

</div>
<p>It was more than a hundred years ago that this trusted
guard did duty; and when he died, not a drum was heard,
and no soldiers fired a volley over his grave. You cannot
find his name on the roll of enlisted men; and yet no soldier
was ever more faithful.</p>

<p>There was war with the Indians at the time of which I
write, and a family of settlers lived in what is now the State
of Maine, on the bank of the River Androscoggin. One day
the children of the family went down by the river to pick
berries.</p>

<p>With the little party of boys and girls went the family
dog. He was trained to follow the trail of Indians, and to
give warning of their approach. The watchful dog took his
place, like a sentinel, near the children, while they ran about
from bush to bush, eating more berries than went into the
pail.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dog gave a low growl, and looked angrily
toward a heap of brush at the edge of the woods. The
children knew what that meant, and, without waiting to see
what the danger was, they ran at once towards the block-house.</p>

<p>The faithful dog did not run, but stood on guard to meet
the Indian whom he had seen coming from the thicket. It
was not far to the house; and the children were soon in a
place of safety, while the Indian skulked back to the woods.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>



<p>Several years
after, when the
war was all over,
this very same
Indian came that
way, and talked with
the children. They
treated him kindly,
and he became their
good friend. But he
often told them of
the danger they all
were in, that afternoon,
when the good
dog gave them such
timely warning.</p>

<p>The dog lived to
a good old age, and was loved and petted by the family as
long as he lived; and to this day the descendants of Enoch
and Esther, Martha and Samuel, the children saved by the
dog, tell the story that I have related, and speak gratefully
of the faithful sentinel.</p>

<h2>BRUCE AND OLD SHEEPY.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 82px;">
<img src="images/drop_m.png" width="82" height="150" alt="M" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ANY years ago, I spent a few weeks with some
friends who lived upon a large milk-farm in the
State of New York. They made a great many
pounds of butter every day, and packed it in firkins
for market. So much churning could not be done
by hand, and, as working by steam was not common then,
they were obliged to employ dogs, and sometimes sheep.</div>

<p>In the basement of the farm-house was a huge churn,
the handle of which was attached to a large barrel made
of slats, in such a way, that, when the barrel revolved, the
churn was worked. When the dairy-maid was ready to
churn, she would lock Bruce, their great dog, into this
barrel, and say to him, "Go on, Bruce." If he went on,
at every step he turned the barrel. The faster the barrel
turned, the faster the churn-handle moved up and down,
and the sooner the butter came.</p>

<p>Bruce did not like this kind of work; and who of us
would? He often tried to shirk it by running away; but
when John, the farmer's son, perceived this trick, he took
care to secure the dog over night. The farmer and his son
were very good to their animals: so, in order that Bruce
might rest, they selected a sheep to perform a part of the
labor. This sheep, though quite young, was never called
by any other name than "Old Sheepy."</p>

<p>The dog and the sheep took turns in the churning thus:
Bruce worked Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; Old
Sheepy worked the other three days of the six. On Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday mornings, Old Sheepy could
never be found without much hunting. The other three
mornings she would leisurely wander near the house, nibbling
the grass near the doorstep.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/illus089a.png" width="252" height="300" alt="Dog's face" />
</div>
<p>So John was obliged to drive her into an enclosure, and
there confine her for the night, previous to her churning, as
it took too much time to find
her in the morning.</p>



<p>One Monday evening, Bruce,
having done his day's work,
was lying on a rug in the sitting-room,
where the farmer's
children and myself were having
a quiet game of "Come,
d'ye come?" At eight o'clock,
Priscilla and John, as if with
one thought, started up from
the game with the words, "Has
any one shut up Old Sheepy?"
No one knew. So off John ran to get the animal, but soon
returned, not able to find her.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 273px;">
<img src="images/illus089b.png" width="273" height="300" alt="Sheepy's face" />
</div>
<p>"No matter," said Priscilla, "Bruce has had an easy time
to-day. We'll put him on to-morrow; for we never had
more cream ready than now."
Bruce pricked up his ears, as
if to say, "Catch me churning
Old Sheepy's butter!"</p>



<p>When bed-time came, Priscilla
said, "I will not let old
Bruce out to-night. I will
put him in the wash-room."
Priscilla didn't quite know
Bruce, if she thought he was
simple enough to be caught
napping after hearing that.
He got out, no one knew how; and there was nothing to
to be done but to wait patiently till morning.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Bruce had no idea of allowing Old Sheepy to get clear of
her task. At midnight a terrible barking and bleating and
growling and scampering, was heard some little distance
from the house. John went out to see what the noise was
about. He found that Bruce had spied Old Sheepy in her
hiding-place, had routed her out, and driven her into the
enclosure; but, as he could not bar the gate, he stood guard
against the opening, and was barking loudly to awaken the
household.</p>

<p>As soon as John appeared upon the scene, Bruce returned
to his rug as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>When Old Sheepy was marched into the barrel the next
morning, you ought to have seen Bruce strutting about the
basement! If Old Sheepy slackened her pace at all, Bruce
would growl; if she didn't mind that, he would bark, and
would not stop until he had succeeded in calling the dairy-maid
to threaten Old Sheepy with the whip.</p>

<p>Priscilla and John thought these little acts of the dog
very wise; but I think a sheep that could tell the days of
the week, as this one was able to do, and knew enough to
run away the night before her turn came, was just as wise
as the dog.</p>

<p>The family were loud in their praise of Bruce, however,
and, as a reward for his shrewdness, talked of relieving
him from further work as soon as they could succeed in
training another sheep.</p>

<p>I left the farm-house before this took place: so I cannot
say how Bruce bore his laurels. But, if I had had my way,
I would have rewarded Old Sheepy too.</p>

<h2>ELFRIDA'S PRESENT.</h2>

<img src="images/drop_e.png" width="61" height="150" alt="E" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />LFRIDA is a little German girl who lives in Bonn.
She has a brother in New York. He sent her, not
long ago, a bound copy of "The Nursery." She was
greatly pleased. She spent much time looking at the
pictures. Then she said, "Oh, how I wish I could
read the stories!"</div>

<p>"You have been saving up your money for some time,"
said her mother. "For what have you been saving it?"</p>

<p>"To buy one of those beautiful dolls that can walk without
being touched: I do so long to have one!" said the little
girl. "But why do you ask, mamma?"</p>

<p>"It was only a passing thought," said mamma.</p>

<p>"But I want to know your passing thought," said Elfrida.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, I thought that one-quarter of the money you
will have to pay for a doll would buy you a nice English-German
dictionary, by help of which you could learn to read
those stories in 'The Nursery.'"</p>

<p>"Let me buy it at once, mamma!" cried Elfrida. "Dolls
are nice; but I would rather have a dictionary. May I not
go to the bookstore, and buy the book now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear: your choice is a wise one. You may go."</p>

<p>Elfrida ran up stairs, put on her cape and bonnet, ran out
to the bookstore, and bought the book.</p>

<p>It was hard at first to find out the meaning of some of
the words. But the stories were simple, and some of the
words were so like the same words in German, that she did
not have to look them out.</p>

<p>One day she came running home from school, and said,
"O mamma! a little American girl named Clara now comes
to our school. She says she will teach me to read."</p>

<p>The little American girl kept her promise. First she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
would give Elfrida a lesson in English, and then Elfrida
would give her a lesson in German. And so they both grew
to be nice little scholars. Elfrida would talk to Clara in
English, and Clara would answer her in German. Soon they
could each talk both languages quite well.</p>

<h2>"PARLEY-VOO."</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/drop_p.png" width="75" height="150" alt="P" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ARLEY-VOO" was the nickname of a little boy four
years old, who was born in Paris. He did not come
home until after he had learned to talk, and then he
spoke French. So, when he went out to play with
the other boys, they laughed at him, and called him
"Parley-voo."</div>

<p>His aunt laughed at him too, sometimes. She was rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a queer aunt, and not at all like the aunts we read of in
story-books. But his father was just the best father that
anybody ever heard of.</p>

<p>They lived in Sunland, a little town not many miles from
Boston; and every morning Parley-voo would hurry down to
give his father a kiss before he went away to his business
in the city. Then, when the train went by, he would stand
at the window, and wave his little white handkerchief, and
then his father would wave back at him, as if to say,
"Good-by, once more, my dear little Parley-voo, good-by!"</p>

<p>But one morning he was so very sleepy, that he could
not open his eyes when his nurse told him it was time to
get up. He called the nurse a <i>bonne</i>, as they do in Paris.
He pushed her away, and went to sleep again, and the first
thing he heard was the train going by with a "choo, choo,
choo," and his father was gone without a kiss.</p>

<p>Then Parley-voo cried, and said it was his <i>bonne's</i> fault.
He went to the window, and there he stood crying. He
could not eat the nice breakfast that his nurse brought him,
and would not let her dress him. So she went away, and
shut the door, and left him to dress himself.</p>

<p>In his hurry he put on one red stocking and one blue one.
His little kilt suit hung so high up in the closet, that he
could not reach it: so he drew on an old faded dress a good
deal too short, and it made him look just like a girl.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 308px;">

</div>
<p>In this rig he went down stairs, and his aunt laughed so
that she almost cried when she saw him. That made him
feel worse than ever, and he grew worse than ever. I am
sorry to tell it; but he flew at her, and kicked her. His
mother could not stop him, and his aunt had to run away.</p>

<p>But before long Parley-voo began to be sorry; for he was
not a bad child, only thoughtless and wilful. And when his
mother whispered to him to go and tell his aunt how sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
he was, the little red and blue legs flew across the room, and
up the stairs to find his aunt.</p>

<p>She sat in her room at her small table, and was taking a
cup of tea. She did not look up when she heard him
coming, and he hardly
dared to go in. But he
had a brave little heart;
and calling out, "Aunty,
I'm sorry," he ran up
to her, and clasping her
neck with his little loving
arms, "I am very
sorry, aunty," he said
again. And they made
it all up.</p>



<p>His aunt told him that
she thought it would be
a good plan to write to his papa, and tell him how it happened
that his little boy was too late to kiss him good-by.
Then she took out of her desk a sheet of paper; and Parley-voo,
with his aunt's help, printed this letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p><i>Dear Papa</i>,&mdash;I did not see you, and I cried. Did you wave to me?
I said it was the <i>bonne's</i> fault, and I dressed myself. Aunt Tib laughed.
I kicked her. I'm sorry. I sha'n't do it any more. Mamma sends
love and three kisses. So do I. Aunt Tib sends her love too.</p>

<div class='sig1'>
Your loving little <span class="smcap">Parley-voo</span>.<br />
</div></div>

<p>After this, Parley-voo and his aunt Tib were the best of
friends. It was a long time before he was too late again to
say good-by to his father, or had any trouble with his <i>bonne</i>.</p>

'Tis snowing fast, hurrah! hurrah!<br />

Away we'll run for healthy fun,<br />

Let me but pull my mittens on,<br />

If you look out the window, Nell,<br />
